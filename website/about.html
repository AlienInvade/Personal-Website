                            Edu Wonders is a company established in 2023, that is dedicated to improving the education 
                            system and safety in schools in South Africa. Therefore, we have provided you with advanced
                            pervasive computing devices available for both schools and learners. The lack of safety in 
                            schools and poor education has been an ongoing problem in our country since the ending of apartheid in 1994.
                            The development of our company aims to bring citizens together to unite and bring an end to these issues. 
                            But that is not all, we at EduWonders have combined technology and fun learning to aid learners in learning basic
                            literacy skills with the help of our new products. Edu Wonders is constantly expanding the range of products since
                            schools are becoming more technologically dominated.</p>
